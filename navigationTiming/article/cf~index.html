<p>People like it when web pages <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html" title="Google Official Research Blog: Speed Matters" target="_blank">load quickly</a>.</p>

<p>Delays as small as a hundred milliseconds can have an adverse effect &ndash; and as Jakob Nielsen <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html" title="Jakob Nielsen: Response Times: The 3 Important Limits" target="_blank">pointed out</a> back in 1993, 'basic advice regarding response times has been about the same for thirty years'.</p>

<p>But now do we measure web page load speed &ndash; and what does 'page load' actually mean?</p>

<p>Web developers and test suites like <a href="http://www2.webkit.org/perf/sunspider-0.9/sunspider.html" title="SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark" target="_blank">SunSpider</a> and <a href="http://dromaeo.com/" title="Dromaeo performance testing" target="_blank">Dromaeo</a> use the JavaScript Date object for timing metrics. A simple speed test might use code at the start of a web page like this:</p>

<code>
var start = Date.now();
</code>

<p>...with code at the end of the page like this:</p>

<code>
console.log("Page load took " + Date.now() - start + "milliseconds");
</code>

<p>Using JavaScript to measure performance in this way is limited and unreliable:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the timing code is in the page, so it will cause an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(information_technology)" title="Wikipedia article: Observer effect (information technology)" target="_blank">observer effect</a>, changing the way the page loads in ways that may be impossible to quantify</li>
	<li>JavaScript time is <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/" title="John Resig: Accuracy of JavaScript Time" target="_blank">not accurate</a></li>
	<li>unless you're happy to leave timing code in a page, you won't be able to measure load speeds in the wild.</li>
</ul>

<p>Worst of all, this in-the-page approach can't measure the total latency users experience when they 'open a page', whether they click on a link or enter a URL in the address bar of their browser, since that latency includes processes such as DNS resolution and server response that occur before page content (and JavaScript timing code) loads. It is possible to use cookies to measure the time taken between the unloading of one page, and loading of the next, but only if you host both pages. This won't work for the crucial first visit to a website &ndash; that small window of opportunity in which new users are either enticed or repelled &ndash; and can only give a total figure, without taking into account nuances such as redirection times.</p>

<p><a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html" title="W3C Navigation Timing Editor's Draft">Navigation Timing</a> changes all that.</p>

<p>This API provides a simple way to get accurate and detailed timing statistics &ndash; natively &ndash; for page navigation and loading.  It's available now in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff975118(v=VS.85).aspx" title="MSDN performance Object documentation" target="_blank">Internet Explorer 9</a> and in <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" title="Google Chrome home page">Google Chrome</a> version 6 and above. It is hoped that the API might be implemented in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff975118(v=VS.85).aspx" title="Mozilla bug report" target="_blank">Firefox 6</a>.</p>

<p>Note that in order to use the performance.timing API in Internet Explorer 9:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>on a web page, use the <pre><!doctype html><pre> directive to ensure the document is displayed in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325" title="MSDN: Defining Document Compatibility">Internet Explorer 9 mode</a></li>
    <li>in the Internet Explorer developer tools console, you may need to adjust the browser or document mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>The simplest way to try out the API is to take a look at a window.performance object in the browser's developer tools JavaScript console. For example, from any web page in Go<font size="+1"></font>ogle Chrome:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select <em>Tools > JavaScript console</em> from the spanner menu at the top right of the Chrome window (or press <em>Crl-Shift-J</em> on Windows or Linux, or<em> Command-Option-J</em> on a Mac)</li>
	<li>Type in the word <em>performance</em> next to the > prompt at the bottom of the window and press return</li>
	<li>Click Performance to see the properties of the object: memory, navigation and timing</li>
	<li>Click the arrow to the left of timing to see its properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should see something like the following, which has been generated with code on this page:</p>

<code id="atts"></code> <!-- filled dynamically by code that follows -->

<script type="text/javascript">
function writeAtts(){
    var atts = [];
    for (prop in performance.timing) {
        if (performance.timing.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            atts.push(prop + ": " + performance.timing[prop]); 
        }
    }
    atts.sort(); // in the console attributes are displayed in alphabetical order
    $("#atts").append(atts.join("<br />"));
}
</script>


<h2>What does it all mean?</h2>

<p>Each performance.timing attribute shows the time of a navigation or page load event, measured in milliseconds since midnight of January 1, 1970 (UTC). A zero value means that an event (such as secureConnectionStart or redirectStart) did not occur.</p>

<p>Descriptions of each of these events are available from the W3C <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html#sec-navigation-timing-interface" title="W3C PerformanceTiming interface documentation" target="_blank">interface draft</a> and Microsoft's performance.timing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff975075" title="MSDN: peformanceTiming members table" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 9 supports all these attributes except secureConnectionStart, and in addition provides the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff974719" title="MSDN: msFirstPaint Property documentation" target="_blank">msFirstPaint</a> event, which occurs after loadEventEnd 'when the document loaded by the window object began to be displayed to the user'.</p>

<p>There are many useful ways to use this information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>responseEnd - fetchStart: network latency</li>
	<li>loadEventEnd - responseEnd: how long the page took to load after it was received from the server</li>
	<li>loadEventEnd - navigationStart: how long the whole process of navigation and page load took.</li>
</ul>


<p>The order of these events is shown in the image below from the <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html#processing-model" title="Navigation Timing Processing Model">Navigation Timing draft</a>:</p>

<h2>How did I get here?</h2>

<p>There are, of course, several ways to 'open a page'. This is where <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html#sec-navigation-info-interface" title="W3C PerformanceNavigation interface documentation" target="_blank">performance.navigation</a> comes in handy. This API has just two attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>redirectCount: the number of times the document request was redirected</li>
	<li>type: the navigation that lead to the page being loaded:</li>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<li>action by the user such as clicking a link or entering a URL in the browser address bar</li>
			<li>page reload</li>
			<li>moving back or forward through history.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
